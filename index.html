    <p>Oswald is a great addition to any major film studio, and here is why:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>He's blindly loyal, almost as if he can't make decisions for himself</li>
      <li>He's OK with not having all of the shine (F U Mickey &#1F600;)</li>
      <li>Doesn't cost nearly as much as the other guys...(mickey)</li>
