  Oswald is a great addition to any major film studio, and here is why:
  <ol>
  <li>He's blindly loyal, almost as if he can't make decisions for himself</li>
  <li>He's OK with not having all of the shine (F U Mickey U+1F91)</li>
  <li>Doesn't cost nearly as much as the other guys...(mickey)</li>
  </ol>
